# Wind-Turbine-Energy-Prediction
To predict the energy generation of a wind turbine in Turkey, an energy model can be created using a multiple ridge regression (L2) function. The model is based on data collected from an operational turbine that generates power and is equipped with a SCADA system for monitoring and data collection. The data used for this purpose was collected at 10-minute intervals throughout the year 2018.
